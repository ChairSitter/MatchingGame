    This is a game of luck in which you play against the computer to 25 points.<br/>
    You have 4 boxes and so does the computer. <br/>
    Each round, the boxes are assigned a randomly generated background color and text color one-by-one.<br/>
    Points are awarded after each round as follows:
    </p>
    <ul id="rule-list">
        <li>   Win the Round: <br/>
        +1 point to the side with more matches (background color matches text color of a box)
        </li> 
        <li>Loose straight:<br/>
    +3 point bonus if all 4 of your boxes have a color in common (background color OR text)
        </li>
        <li>Strict straight:<br/>
    +5 point bonus if all 4 boxes have the same background color, or the same text color
        </li>
        <li>Four matches:<br/>
